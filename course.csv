To the point of networking, I want you to take 5 minutes to turn to the person to your left and right, and introduce yourself...right now, what is your biggest concern / priority? (I dont feel prepared to enter the business world, I am intimated by the technical skills, I dont know what I want to do, etc). As you see, we all have that common ground....we have an area to work though and thats why we are here. To learn together, support from our peers, and grow. Who knows, you may be working side-by-side in the near future!  I always learned the most from my peers, not managers!",4

Subj: Haverford Senior, Interested in Learning about E&Y Healthcare Practice
Dear Mr. Elliot,
I hope this message finds you well. I am a current senior interested in learning about your experience as the Healthcare Practice Leader at Ernst & Young.
To give a brief background, I started my career in business by working at a boutique consulting company analyzing the data of hospitals to determine opportunities for cost-reductions. It was a great experience that helped me further narrow my interest in consulting, particularly in Healthcare. Sophomore year I decided to focus my studies in mathematics, economics, and also taking several courses at PENN focusing on business strategy. At the end of sophomore year, I was invited to attend a healthcare consulting seminar at Dartmouth where I had a chance to be on a panelist board discussing how hospitals can reduce costs by scheduling patent visits in advance instead of accepting last minute appointments and overbooking doctors. I  found the discussion to be very exciting. Junior year I began my major courses that helped me continue to sharpen my technical skills. During junior year I volunteered at a community center helping adults with disabilities learn to use computers and work with basic software; this was a form of occupational therapy. Recently, I came across an E&Y white paper about the reduction of insurance fees incurred to hospitals if occupational therapy and pre-liminary wellness screening options was offered by healthcare practitioners. I was curious how you think this could be implemented if it wouldnt be in the best interest of insurance companys? Would they comply with the change knowing that hospitals would ultimately benefit?
Now that I am wrapping up my senior year, I believe consulting would be the best career for me, and I believe hearing about your experiences would only help me better understand what I will be pursuing. 
Thank you,
Steve Superfluous","PANOS

Analyze
Analyze the collected information using advanced analytical methods and models to define business strengths, risks, or trends
Measure
A suggested strategy is not complete unless it generates real value for the business.

Using ongoing monitoring of sample datasets, teams conduct measurements to ensure a client or dept is on-track for successfully achieving the value of the newly suggested strategies
Deliver, Repeat.. Automate!
For even greater efficiency, develop intuitive models and automated reports to replicate the whole process according to what clients or execs want to see; so theyll spend more time focusing on strategy rather than re-doing data collection and analysis
Interpret business stories through complex data analysis and deliver key messages. This process will help confidently direct next step strategies that pave the right course for a business future

A record is an item or entity in a table with its attributes listed across a row. For example, a record may have a name of 'aspen tree', a height of '3 meters', and a type of 'deciduous'. Records are sometimes called tuples.
A primary key is an attribute of a record that uniquely identifies it from all other records in the table. For example, a telephone number or a unique ID number can be used as a primary key. Primary keys are used to specify records when querying data from multiple tables.
A column is a set of data values of a particular type. Here, id, name, and age are the columns. 
A row is a single record in a table.

Hi Oliver  Interesting findings from the Aesop team. For our revenue-generating lines, looks like we have some high risk areas in LATAM infrastructure, and OneBank across NA and APAC. We have some really profitable momentum with Device Banking in LATAM, helping the overall product line. 

@CIOWendy  any idea whats driving the LATAM infrastructure costs?

Hi Cindy  I figured the LATAM costs were going to catch up to us at some point. The region doesnt have mature networks or domestic vendors to setup robust systems to manage our Apple Produce Device Banking.

Storytellers, by the very act of telling, communicate a radical learning that changes lives and the world: telling stories is a universally accessible means through which people make meaning.

""Developing excellent COMMUNICATION skills is absolutely essential to effective leadership. The leader must be able to share knowledge and ideas to transmit a sense of urgency and enthusiasm to others.

Effective Presentation Development,,235
"

The Steps to Storyboarding
The presentation starts with an overall idea, problem statement, or mission to solve

The idea or mission is then broken-down into key sections with specific subjects determined by the authors


Designated owners start to develop the slides with content that relates to the subject > section > mission 
(connecting the dots) 


A successfully storyboarded presentation guides the audience through your thought process and leaves them with a impactful message, request, or suggestion that resonates

Signs Storyboard of Success: 

Inter-group Conversations
Insightful Questions
Progressive follow-ups asking for more!","PANOS


Panos: Think about anytime you start a paper or thesis, you have an outline. Its the same exact concept here, have an outline that you will fill in with proof points. Thats why liberal arts students make for effective presentation creators. 
Panos: Take about signs of a storyboard success  audience is following along, no glazed eyes, relevant or insightful questions.",236
"A Title that Preps the Audience for the Slide Subject & Content
A concise and impactful opening statement that summarizes or describes the slide content, typically no more than 2 sentences....
Visually digestible with a balance of white space and content...
Use non-distracting shapes or graphics that have a purposeful relation to the content
Avoid text clutters, and content that overlaps or is distractingly misaligned
Use white space, breathing room between content to help expedite content absorption

Understandable statements that are concise, well-organized and positioned 
Presentations are not the place for a thesis, but for key bulleted points that can be spoken to
Verbage matters; use meaningful words, lingos, or phrases that the audience can understand

Use targeted focus techniques to make your point stand-out
Using targeting techniques can make the slide more interactive and adds focus areas on key points 
E.g. Bolding or sizing text, headers, or using different text colors to make words or sections standout (red text to indicate issues, risks, or negative metrics)
Use shapes to draw attention to certain sections, charts, or metrics (dotted circles) 

Consistent and standardized formatting across the whole presentation...
Standard slide structure & setup (prevents audience eye re-adjusting with every new slide)
Company color scheme
Consistent formatting techniques (font sizes  not too tiny or too large, same text styles, colors)
","PANOS


Panos: The techniques to construct a presentation with good flow. 
1) Having consistency in format and slide structure  will show order and prevent the audience from re-adjusting each time to focus on content. Shows also consistency for branding
2) Think of this slide like a canvas, a canva to communicate a really important topic. Working with white space is the key to best demonstrate your thoughts...its called breathing room, you cant cram every little piece of information, you have to decide whats important. 
3) Writing concise is much harder than writing verbose, think that every word or metric matters. How and where you position that is also critical....top down for executive summary, left to right for flow...or connect the dots of breaking down charts. Positioning DOES matter. 
4) Whats the so what? What do you want the audience to focus on? ",237

"Business Case: CEOs Update Request
Q118 has been a very busy period at EcommTV. With the latest launch of the EcommTV marketing campaign in partnership with Comcast, the influx of new subscribers has generated significant growth but has also been overwhelming for product teams. CEO Biyu H. has been notified that the firm has experienced the highest subscriber cancellations since the start of the company in 2016.

Given EcommTVs already strained teams, Biyu has contacted her network of consultants to request some strategic analysis support. Consulting firms have jumped on the opportunity to conduct a diagnostic in order to hopefully build a long-term relationship as the go-to advisory firm for EcommTV. 

After initial meetings with Biyu, minutes have captured these key questions to answer for CEO:

(1) Cost & reason of cancellations by industry (2) What are the subscription types (characteristics) being cancelled and the overall value lost by demographic (3) a MoM trend chart using a ratio of cancelled to new account value for Q1, what were the top 3 accounts driving the losses and new wins? (4) Proposed solutions or strategic recommendations for EcommTV

** Sent with High Importance**: Root Cause Deep-Dive

Hi team, 

Thank you so much for your work so far. It slipped my mind to ask you for this as well, but would be very helpful to also understand  for the clients who cancelled due to product issues, which months did problems with the product occur and root cause of the problems. This deep-dive will really help us understand the root cause of those lost accounts

Thank you,
Biyu

"Reason for Cancellations
Financial Services (Cost of Cancellation: $32.1 million lost)
All of the companies within these industries cited product issues as their reason for cancelling
Most issues for occurred with financial product breaks (i.e. Product Ecommerce Break, Freeze Screen, Host Site Error)
Oil & Gas ($300K) and Tech Startup ($6.7 million) faced similar issues
Hospitality and Food Services ($25.4 million)
Companies decided to cancel due to either Building In-house or Competitor Products
i.e. Customers were finding substitutes to the product, either from other companies (Amazon) or creating their own alternative
Note: The only 2 premium account cancellations were amongst these companies",,315
Reason for Cancellations,,316
"Recommended Solutions
Debugging and Troubleshooting technological issues that are prevalent and quickly resolving any future problems that arise
Possibly think about working less with SMB Financial Services firms in the future.
Monitor the newly acquired ENT Financial Services firms to make sure similar issues do not arise.",,317
